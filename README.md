## Description
The _printf() function takes one argument: A string with / without specifiers to print and gives the output formatted.

The string is printed character by character and when founds a '%' with a letter calls one of that parameters and print them instead the specifiers.

## Format Specifiers

Format generators are a format with which we tell the function to take the arguments ​​according to the indicated type.
- %c: Print a character passed as parameter.
- %s: Prints a string.
- %%: Print a percentage symbol.
- %d: Prints a signed decimal number.
- %i: Prints a signed number (int).
- %b: Converts the unsigned integer to binary and prints it.
- %r: Print the inverted string.
. %R: Use ROT13 to converts the letters with the thirteenth letter forward of the alphabet.

## Future Features
- %u: Prints an unsigned decimal number.
- %o: Prints the octal unsigned integer conversion.
- %x: Unsigned hex conversion to lowercase.
- %X: Unsigned hex conversion to uppercase.
- %p: Print a memory address(pointer).

## Bugs
- %b: The specifier %b doesn't work all correctly
